Especially, the screws in the Reachy&amp;rsquo;s back and the ones fixatings its metal support should be well tightened.
Turning on/off the motors #
If at anytime when you&amp;rsquo;re working with Reachy you feel that you&amp;rsquo;re losing control of the robot&amp;rsquo;s movements, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to turn the motors off. Use the switch button placed in its back.</description></item><item><title>Record and play trajectories</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/record/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:39:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/record/</guid><description>You can easily record joint trajectories directly on Reachy, store and replay them later. This page will show you how to implement such mechanisms.
All examples given below will show trajectories record on each of the robot joints. The position of each motor will be stored at a predefined frequency (typically 100Hz). Similarly, the replay will set new target position using the same frequency. Those basics examples does not perform any kind of filtering or modification of the data.</description></item><item><title>Arms kinematics</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/kinematics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:39:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/kinematics/</guid><description>Make sure you checked the safety page before controling the arm.
This page assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot and that you also know how to use the goto() function presented in Controling the arm.
Arm coordinate system #
Joint coordinates #
If you remember the goto() function, to generate a trajectory for the requested joints you need to pass a dictionnary of joints with the requested position as the goal_positions argument.</description></item><item><title>Once you're connected</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/intro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:38:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/intro/</guid><description>If you followed the instructions from [&amp;ldquo;Finding Reachy&amp;rsquo;s IP&amp;rdquo;], you know how to get Reachy&amp;rsquo;s IP address and how to connect to the robot with the command:
from reachy_sdk import ReachySDK
reachy = ReachySDK(host='192.168.0.42') # Replace with the actual IP
The reachy object #
The reachy object instanciated above is the main tool to access the information coming from Reachy&amp;rsquo;s sensors (joints, force sensors, cameras) and to control each part of the robot (left/right arm, head).</description></item><item><title>Controlling the head</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/head/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:38:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/head/</guid><description>Make sure you checked the safety page before controling the arm.
This section assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot.
Head presentation #
Reachy&amp;rsquo;s head is composed of three parts:
a front side where two cameras equipped with motorized zoom are attached, a back side equiped with two antennas to convey emotions along with two fans in the inner part to cool down the components inside the head, a neck ball joint, thanks to our Orbita actuator.</description></item><item><title>Controlling the fans</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/fans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:38:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/fans/</guid><description>This section assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot.
Reachy is equipped with fans to cooldown the joints when they are working. Each arm has three fans and two fans are in the head.
First, connect to your Reachy.
from reachy_sdk import ReachySDK
reachy = ReachySDK(host='192.168.0.42') # Replace with the actual IP
reachy.fans
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Holder
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;l_shoulder_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;l_elbow_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;l_wrist_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;r_shoulder_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;r_elbow_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;r_wrist_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;l_antenna_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Fan name=&amp;quot;r_antenna_fan&amp;quot; state=&amp;quot;off&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
As explained in the safety page, the temperature of each joint is controlled internally in Reachy and if it reaches a certain value, the corresponding fan turns on.</description></item><item><title>Reachy's cameras</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/cameras/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:38:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/cameras/</guid><description>This section assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot.
Reachy 2023 has two high quality cameras which can deliver up to 1080p at 30 fps. Each camera is equipped with a motorized zoom allowing to adapt the zoom and focus levels to the situation you&amp;rsquo;re working on.
Each camera can be accessed separately with reachy.left_camera and reachy.right_camera.
First, connect to your Reachy.</description></item><item><title>Controlling the arm</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/arm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:38:27 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/arm/</guid><description>Make sure you checked the safety page before controlling the arm.

Arm presentation #
Reachy&amp;rsquo;s arm offers 7 degrees of freedom + 1 provided by the gripper and is composed of 8 joints.
The arm&amp;rsquo;s mechanical specifications are given here but as a reminder, the arm schematic is given below:</description></item></channel></rss>
