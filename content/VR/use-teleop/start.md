{{< warning icon="👉🏾" text="Before starting teleoperating Reachy, please make sure you read the  <b><a href=\"https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/vr/use-teleop/best-practice/\">Best Practice</a></b>" >}}

## In brief

{{< alert icon="👉" text="The button names used below are for the Oculus Quest 2. Please refer to the Controllers Input page to get the corresponding names for your device." >}}

### Start teleoperating Reachy

1. Make sure the robot is turned on, connected to the network and that all the robot's services are running before launching the teleoperation application.

2. Select the robot you want to teleoperate (or create a new one), and click on "Connect".

3. Get familiar with the controls in the mirror room and the virtual robot. You may configure various settings here. When you are ready press "Ready", and hold (A).

4. **Look straight ahead, with your body in the same orientation as your head while pressing A** to start the teleoperation. *The initial head position is used to determine the coordinate system giving your VR controllers position.* 

{{< alert icon="👉" text="<b>Warning:</b> you <b>must not move your body</b> anymore after this step. The position of your VR controllers to master the robot arms are calculated depending on the position you had while pressing A." >}}

{{< warning icon="🚨" text="<b>Important:</b> even if Reachy is bio-inspired, it cannot reproduce exactly all your movements. There are <b>positions that cannot be reached</b> by the robot. Please <b>avoid unusual movements</b> and do not persist in trying to reach a position if you see that the robot is stuck before it." >}}

5. Come back any time to mirror room by **holding A**. Teleoperation of the robot is automatically paused if the headset is removed.

{{< alert icon="👉" text="Please <b>stop teleoperation before removing your headset</b> (go back to mirror room or quit the app). If you do not, Reachy will continue following your controllers and headset orientation, and this can cause damages to the robot." >}}

### Stop teleoperation

1. Come back to the **mirror room** to pause the teleoperation by **holding A** at any time during teleoperation.  

2. Leave the app by clicking "**Quit**" icons in the mirror room and connection menu. 

The motors are automatically turned into compliant mode when quitting the mirror room. Please make sure the arms are close enough to the lowest position they can reach when coming back to the menu to avoid them falling or hitting something.  


## Step-by-step starting
1. Make sure that your VR equipement is up and running. Please refer to your device documentation.

2. Make sure the robot is turned on, connected to the network and that all the robot services are running. *By default, if you haven't modified anything, all services should be automatically launched on start of the **full/starter kit** robots.*

3. Launch the application *TeleoperateReachy.exe* file if you are using a VR device connected to a Windows computer. For Oculus Quest users, start the app from within the headset if you have installed the *.apk*.

4. Equip yourself with your headset, make sure you can see both controllers and that the scene around you is moving correctly in accordance with your head movements.

5. Choose the robot you want to connect to: you can select a robot with its IP address, or add a new one to the list of available robots.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/select-robot.png" 600x "Select robot to connect">}}

6. Press *Connect* to initiate the communication with the robot.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/connect.png" 600x "Connect to a robot">}}

7. You should be now in the mirror room, and see yourself controlling a virtual reachy. The actual robot is not in control at that time but the live camera stream is displayed at the top right of the mirror. The info, help and settings menus are available here (they are documented in the next section). Please get familiar with the robot controls and features (emotion, grasping lock).

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/mirror.png" 600x "Mirror scene">}}

8. When you are ready, **face the mirror completely** and click on "Ready". The position of the actual robot appears in a semi-transparent green color. This may be useful when you've left the robot in a certain position that you would like to keep when entering the teleoperation. Hold (A) to start the teleoperation.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/mirror-ready.png" 600x "Start teleoperation">}}

9. A 3 seconds timer appears while you enter the teleoperation. The motors speeds are reduced during this time to avoid sudden movements of the robot. Full speed is reached at the end of this countdown.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/timer-start.png" 600x "Validate position before starting">}}

{{< alert icon="👉" text="<b>Warning:</b> you <b>don't want to move your torso and body</b> anymore after this step. Only your head and arms. The position of your VR controllers to master the robot arms are calculated depending on the position you had while pressing A." >}}

10. Come back any time to menu by **pressing A**. Teleoperation of the robot is automatically paused if the headset is removed.

## Control the mobile base
Use the **thumbstick/trackpad** to control the mobile base!  
The **left controller controls the translation** of the mobile base, while the **right one controls the rotation**.  

**Is there any security to prevent collision with objects?**  

**Yes!** If you are too close to a wall or object, the LIDAR anti-collision safety unables the mobile base to go closer to the obstacle. The mobile base will therefore not move in this direction, but you can still go in other directions.  
[More information on the anti-collision safety](https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/mobile-base/safety/)  

Nevertheless, this security is for the mobile base and won't prevent the robot's arms to collide with external objects, so be aware while teleoperating the robot.  

*Please note very small objects won't be detected by the LIDAR sensor.*

**What is the forward direction of Reachy?**  

The forward direction is aligned with the **forward direction of the mobile base**, meaning that giving a forward instruction to the robot will always lead the robot to go physically forward, no matter the direction you are looking to.   

Check the actual direction of your commands using the **indicator** at the bottom: the white arrow shows you the direction command relative to your actual head orientation. If your head is correctly aligned with the mobile base forward direction, this arrow will point forward if giving a forward command with your left controller.  
{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/straight_forward.png" 600x "Forward direction looking straight">}}
{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/head_on_side_forward.png" 600x "Forward direction looking on the left">}}   

In the above images, the same forward command is sent from the left controller.   
On the first image, the user is looking straight (the black arrow is located in the target view), so the white mobility arrow is pointing front.   
On the second image, the user is looking on the left side (the target view is on the left of the black arrow), so the forward direction is pointing right, as it is the direction aligned with the mobile base forward direction.   

*Note that these images are only for example, mobility is not available on virtual Reachy.*


## Use Reachy's emotions
Press (X) *(on Oculus Quest 2, [check here the input corresponding to your device](https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/vr/use-teleop/commands/))* when controlling Reachy to open the emotion menu. Use the right thumbstick/trackpad to select the desired emotion icon and release (X).
{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/online-menu.png" 600x "Online menu">}}

Emotion (movement of antennas) are triggered here. The grasping lock can be also activated from this menu.
