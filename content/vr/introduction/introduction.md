The Virtual Reality (VR) teleoperation application enables you to **control the robot remotely** with VR device.  

{{< youtube lRWna6mEMv0 >}}  
</br>
By connecting to your robot, the teleoperation application gives you the ability to **move Reachy's arm** with the tracking of the VR controllers, to **rotate Reachy's head** following your own head movements and to **see through Reachy's cameras**.  

You can also **manipulate objects** remotely controlling Reachy's grippers with your controllers' triggers.  

Finally, animate Reachy's antennas to **share emotions** with remote people thanks to predefined antennas movements you can select.
