## Hardware

To display Reachy's IP address, four components are needed:
* [LCD display](https://www.amazon.fr/AZDelivery-pouces-Arduino-Raspberry-microcontr√¥leur/dp/B01L9GC470/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Adafruit%2Bgrayscale&qid=1626104484&sr=8-3&th=1)
* [Arduino Nano Every](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-every)
* cables to solder between the LCD and the Arduino
* a micro USB cable to connect the Arduino to Reachy's NUC.

## Flashing the Arduino

The code for the Arduino can be found [here](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy-dashboard/blob/main/arduino/serial_communication.ino). Basically, it just listens to messages containing the IP address coming from Reachy's NUC on the serial bus, recovers the IP and displays it on the LCD screen.

The [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2) will be needed to flash the Arduino.

## Wiring
* GND pin of the LCD display goes with GND pin of the Arduino
* VCC pin of the LCD display goes with 5V pin of the Arduino
* SCL pin of the LCD display goes with A5 pin of the Arduino
* SDA pin of the LCD display goes with A4 pin of the Arduino
