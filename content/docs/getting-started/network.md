## Hard-wired connection

**For Full/Starter kit only:**  

Use an **ethernet cable** to connect your robot to the network.
The ethernet plug is available at position (b) on [Reachyâ€™s hardware interface].  
The computer inside Reachy is configured to use DHCP. It should thus be directly accessible on your network.

## WiFi

**For Full/Starter kit only:**

Reachy is equipped with a Wi-Fi module! You can then directly connect Reachy to your network wirelessly.  
*Note: if you are connected to Reachy remotely and depending on your use, we advise to favor an ethernet connection to benefit from a more stable connection.*
