We developed a dashboard to give you an overview of the state of your Reachy (which motors are detected, what services are running, what are the motors temperatures...) as well as giving you the possiblity to access quickly some features (changing a robot's part compliance for example).

This tool has been thought to help you **start easier with the robot** and **facilitate quick debugging**.

Follow the instructions on the dashboard [first connection page] to learn how to connect your Reachy to your wireless network without needing to plug a computer screen, keyboard or mouse.
