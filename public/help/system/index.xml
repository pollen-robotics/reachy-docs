An unplugged cable can be spotted more or less easily in each part of an arm, except for the shoulder pitch motor inside Reachy&amp;rsquo;s torso which is a bit harder.
A typical arm of Reachy is composed of eight motors. The motors are connected as a chain starting with the shoulder pitch. Each motor is connected to the motors located before and after it in the chain.</description></item><item><title>Disconnected force sensor</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/reconnect-load-sensor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 08:47:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/reconnect-load-sensor/</guid><description>TODO: update
Each arm of Reachy is equipped with a load sensor to measure how much force is applied by the gripper to the object. It allows to know when the gripper is holding an object.
The load sensor is in two part: the sensor itself and an electronic board reading its values and connected to Reachy&amp;rsquo;s internal computer.
The sensor is placed between the two 3D printed pieces composing Reachy&amp;rsquo;s gripper.</description></item><item><title>Focus a camera manually</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/manual-focus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 08:46:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/manual-focus/</guid><description>If for some reason the autofocus implemented in Reachy did not work (due to dust in the lens for example), it is possible to focus the camera by hand. To do that, first connect to Reachy using reachy-sdk:
from reachy_sdk import ReachySDK
reachy = ReachySDK('your-reachy-ip-address')
Changing the focus with the PythonSDK #
Once connected, let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to make the focus of the left camera. You will need to change the focus value by hand.</description></item><item><title>Finding Reachy's IP</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/find-my-ip/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 08:46:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/find-my-ip/</guid><description>There is a few option to find Reachy&amp;rsquo;s IP. It depends on your setup and how you want to use it.
Checking the LCD display screen in Reachy&amp;rsquo;s back #
A small LCD screen should be installed in Reachy’s back to display Reachy’s IP address. You will need to take down its tee-shirt to see the LCD screen.
Working directly on Reachy #
You can run the SDK directly on Reachy&amp;rsquo;s computer.</description></item><item><title>Check which motors are connected</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/discovery-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 08:46:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/discovery-tool/</guid><description>Reachy&amp;rsquo;s SDK Server might not work due to a motor that have been disconnected during transportation or manipulation. Knowing which motors are actually detected by Reachy&amp;rsquo;s software is really useful for debug.
Running the discovery #
You can run the discovery python script to detect the connected motors.
Make sure that the motors are turned on using the power switch in Reachy&amp;rsquo;s back.
In a terminal, use the command:
reachy-discovery
This python script will look at each robot&amp;rsquo;s part (e.</description></item><item><title>Reachy's computer is not running</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/computer-not-running/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 08:46:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/help/system/computer-not-running/</guid><description>Reachy&amp;rsquo;s computer is off, even after pressing the on button #
When you power your robot and turn on both the motors and Reachy&amp;rsquo;s computer, you might have Reachy&amp;rsquo;s computer still not turned on.
There are two ways to check this:
check Reachy&amp;rsquo;s computer power button If the computer is turned on, there should be a round white led around the button brighting.
check if the computer fan is running To do that, first lower Reachy&amp;rsquo;s tee-shirt, on the front side you should see something like this:</description></item></channel></rss>
